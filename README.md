# 📊 User Retention Analysis in a Mobile Game

This repository presents an analytical report investigating an unexpected decrease in user retention in a mobile game. The analysis was conducted using Tableau dashboards and is based on game data collected during January 2019.

The primary aim is to explore potential causes behind a mid-month drop in player retention and to suggest actionable recommendations for improving user engagement and game design.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Despite strong initial user engagement, the game showed a sudden drop in user retention rates around the middle of the observed period. The key objective of this analysis was to identify potential reasons and contributing factors behind this anomaly.

## 📄 Report Highlights

- **Retention Trends**: Notable decline in day_1, day_3, and day_7 retention rates, particularly after the mid-point of the month.
- **Level Completion Rate**: Sudden decrease observed; level 1 and 3 showed strong correlations with overall retention.
- **Gameplay Metrics**: Despite consistent average playtime and daily user count, completion rates dropped—suggesting increased difficulty or technical issues.
- **Possible Causes**: Sudden game update, bug, or design flaw affecting early levels.

## 🧪 Key Findings

- Level 1 and 3 completion rates strongly influence overall retention.
- Mid-month change in game environment likely responsible for declining engagement.
- Average playtime and daily users remained stable—implying design or technical factors at play.

## ✅ Recommendations

1. Adjust gameplay difficulty curve more gradually.
2. Improve testing & QA to avoid bugs and crashes.
3. Optimize design of early levels (especially level 1 & 3).
4. Communicate changes clearly to users.
5. Monitor player feedback regularly.
6. Introduce better in-game rewards.
7. Adopt a strategy for continuous data analysis.
